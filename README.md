# dna-ancestry-testing

**Desc.**

i developed this for the incoming interns as a use case for our genetic modeling after completing full length alignment via data analysis

this serves as a test case (as well as the test cases within), for interns to build off of in specialized projects

**User Info:**

- This can be easily applied to many of our genetic alignment and projection algorithms

- First, walk through the code, and break it back down into its pseudocode

- From there, repurpose it to your specialty
  
  - For ease of understanding, specialization protocol is commented within the code
